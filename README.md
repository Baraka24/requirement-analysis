## Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository captures the requirement analysis for an Airbnb-like application. It defines scope, goals, and constraints; consolidates functional and non-functional requirements; and provides user stories and acceptance criteria to align stakeholders. The materials here guide architecture, UX, implementation planning, and testing, serving as the single source of truth for delivery.

### What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the disciplined process of discovering, clarifying, documenting, and validating what a system must do and the constraints under which it must operate. It converts stakeholder needs into clear, testable, and prioritized requirements that guide all downstream work.
Why it matters in the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
- The Requirement Analysis phase is crucial as it lays the foundation for all subsequent stages of the SDLC. It ensures that the development team understands what the stakeholders need, which helps in delivering a product that meets user expectations.
- By clearly defining requirements, the risk of scope creep is minimized, allowing for better project management and resource allocation.
- It facilitates effective communication among stakeholders, developers, and testers, ensuring everyone is aligned on project goals and deliverables.
- Proper requirement analysis leads to higher quality software, as it reduces the likelihood of defects and rework during later stages of development.
- It supports compliance with regulatory and industry standards by ensuring that all necessary requirements are captured and addressed.
- Ultimately, thorough requirement analysis contributes to the overall success of the project, enhancing user satisfaction and business value.
- Planning: sets scope boundaries, identifies assumptions and risks, and enables estimation and roadmap planning.
- Design: informs architecture and UX with quality attributes (performance, security, availability, usability, compliance).
- Implementation: populates the backlog with well-formed user stories and acceptance criteria, reducing ambiguity and rework.
- Testing: supplies traceable, testable requirements for test planning and coverage; supports a requirements traceability matrix.
- Deployment and operations: NFRs drive capacity planning, monitoring, SLAs, and operational constraints.
- Maintenance and evolution: structured change control and impact analysis minimize regression and scope drift.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC for several key reasons:

1. **Reduces Development Costs and Rework**: Identifying and correcting requirements errors early is exponentially cheaper than fixing defects discovered during testing or post-deployment. Clear requirements minimize misunderstandings that lead to costly rework and wasted development effort.

2. **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment and Satisfaction**: Thorough requirement analysis establishes a shared understanding among all stakeholdersâ€”business owners, users, developers, and testers. This alignment ensures the final product meets actual user needs and business objectives, leading to higher satisfaction and adoption rates.

3. **Provides a Foundation for Quality and Testing**: Well-defined requirements serve as the basis for test cases, acceptance criteria, and quality metrics. They enable comprehensive test coverage, support validation activities, and provide objective criteria for determining when the system is ready for release.

Core activities:
- Elicitation: interviews, workshops, observation, surveys, document analysis, prototyping.
- Analysis and modeling: user stories/use cases, workflows, domain models, data/state diagrams.
- Specification: SRS/BRD or product backlog with acceptance criteria and definitions of done.
- Validation and verification: reviews, walkthroughs, prototypes, and stakeholder sign-off.
- Management: prioritization, baselining, versioning, and end-to-end traceability.

Typical deliverables: glossary, personas, user stories, acceptance criteria, functional and non-functional requirements, and a traceability matrix.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

**Requirement Gathering**
- Collecting high-level business needs, constraints, and objectives from stakeholders and existing documentation
- Identifying sources of requirements including business stakeholders, end users, regulatory bodies, and legacy systems
- Assembling background materials such as business cases, market research, competitor analysis, and existing system documentation
- Establishing the project context, scope boundaries, and initial assumptions

**Requirement Elicitation**
- Conducting structured interviews and workshops with stakeholders to uncover detailed needs and expectations
- Facilitating brainstorming sessions and focus groups to generate ideas and identify pain points
- Observing users in their work environment to understand actual workflows and unspoken requirements
- Using questionnaires and surveys to gather input from large or distributed user groups
- Analyzing existing documentation, processes, and systems to extract implicit requirements
- Creating prototypes and mockups to help stakeholders articulate and refine their needs

**Requirement Documentation**
- Recording requirements in a clear, consistent, and structured format (user stories, use cases, or formal specifications)
- Writing detailed descriptions with acceptance criteria, preconditions, postconditions, and business rules
- Creating a comprehensive glossary to define domain terminology and ensure common understanding
- Organizing requirements into logical categories (functional, non-functional, technical, business)
- Maintaining metadata such as priority, source, rationale, and dependencies for each requirement

**Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
- Analyzing requirements for completeness, consistency, feasibility, and testability
- Identifying conflicts, gaps, and ambiguities that need resolution
- Prioritizing requirements based on business value, risk, dependencies, and stakeholder input
- Creating visual models such as use case diagrams, process flows, data models, and state diagrams
- Decomposing high-level requirements into more detailed, implementable specifications
- Assessing technical and operational feasibility of proposed requirements

**Requirement Validation**
- Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and alignment with business goals
- Conducting walkthroughs and inspection sessions to identify errors, omissions, and inconsistencies
- Validating requirements against acceptance criteria and quality standards
- Obtaining formal sign-off and approval from key stakeholders
- Ensuring requirements are verifiable, traceable, and measurable
- Establishing a baseline for change control and version management
